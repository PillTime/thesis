mesh_path_assign_nexthop:
    supposedly it's used to alter the mesh table, but gets called even if that doesn't happen
    might be called every time an update is a possibility
    or simply updates everytime, replacing what's already there with the same thing most of the time
    (see how it's executed every time a ping is made, even if a ping had been done before)
    likely comes from `hwmp_route_info_get` in `mesh_hwmp.c`

mesh_path_lookup:
    every time an address needs to be found
mpp_path_lookup:
    same as mesh_path_lookup
mesh_path_lookup_by_idx:
    used by mesh_path_lookup
mpp_path_lookup_by_idx
    used by mpp_path_lookup

mesh_path_add_gate:
    (assumed, never seen)
    used whenever a gate is added

mesh_gate_num:
    ???

mesh_path_add:
    used when a new path is added to the mesh table
    only used in new pings
    likely comes from `hwmp_route_info_get` in `mesh_hwmp.c`

mesh_plink_broken:
    ???
mesh_path_flush_by_nexthop:
    ???
mesh_path_flush_by_iface:
    ???

mesh_path_del:
    (assumed, never seen)
    opposite of add, only executed when removing a path

mesh_path_tx_pending:
    executed always right after mesh_path_assign_nexthop
    likely comes from `hwmp_route_info_get` in `mesh_hwmp.c`

mesh_path_send_to_gates:
    ???
mesh_path_discard_frame:
    ???
mesh_path_flush_pending:
    ???
mesh_path_fix_nexthop:
    ???

mesh_pathtbl_init:
    most likely executed when the station/interface is initialized

mesh_path_expire:
    executed after some time, doesn't seem to remove paths from the tables
    most likely only tags them as expired

mesh_pathtbl_unregister:
    ???
